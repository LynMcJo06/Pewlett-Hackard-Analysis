# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7, SQL, Employee Database
## Introduction
Pewlett-Hackard (PH) is a large company, hosting several thousand employees.  PW has also been around for numerous years.  As the "baby-boomer" generation retires, PH will be faced with offering retirement packages and filling those vacated positions.  PH has fallen behind in the database department, and it will be Bobby's and my task to get this organized for the company. To help Bobby prepare for his analysis, we will need to download the following tools: PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. We will use Postgres to create a database, and pgAdmin to work with the data that needs to be imported. We will be conducting our analysis using Structured Query Language (SQL).  Like Python, SQL requires a code editor with the ability to execute the queries.  We will use PostgreSQL and pgAdmin.  
### Lesson 1
Today I added six csv files to the Data folder.  These files will be used in the upcoming week.
