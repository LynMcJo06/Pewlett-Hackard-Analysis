# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7, SQL, Employee Database
## Introduction
Pewlett-Hackard (PH) is a large company, hosting several thousand employees.  PW has also been around for numerous years.  As the "baby-boomer" generation retires, PH will be faced with offering retirement packages and filling those vacated positions.  PH has fallen behind in the database department, and it will be Bobby's and my task to get this organized for the company. To help Bobby prepare for his analysis, we will need to download the following tools: PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. We will use Postgres to create a database, and pgAdmin to work with the data that needs to be imported. We will be conducting our analysis using Structured Query Language (SQL).  Like Python, SQL requires a code editor with the ability to execute the queries.  We will use PostgreSQL and pgAdmin.  
### Lesson 1
Today, I added six csv files to the Data folder, which will be used in the upcoming week.  PostgresSQL was downloaded with pgAdmin.  I identified data relationships between the six different csv files.  I learned the importance of identifying primary keys and foreign keys.  This will help me create relationships between the different files.  Using Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), I will create a flowchart between the tables.  There are three types of ERDs:  conceptual, logical, and physical.  Each type builds upon the other.  I created my map of the tables using Quick DBD and saved the diagram as a PNG for future reference.
